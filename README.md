# expr_cpp
expression evalution library for C++

More or less, a modern c++ version of expression evaluator used
in lcd4linux. One could say that this is a fork, but it isn't
as it's completely hand-written from scratch just following
original's idea and features. But yet, for original work I do
give my respects for author of expression module in lcd4linux,
purely genious even when it's pretty old.

I am attempting to make a rather limited new version of
lcd4linux (name to be decided later, currently name just is lcd2)
atleast on behalf of it's driver's as I only have one
screen available and have no plans to write more driver's -
when project is pushed to a repository and considered as
useful, PR's can be accepted though my plans also are that
it only would support "graphic screens". DPF driver is in
progress.

On other hand, this will be more versatile and feature rich
than original, and on other hand - it is possible that some
features will be left out as well or some behaviour changes
should be expected.

This will be written as a git submodule that can be easily
merged with other projects. On it's own, this is mostly
useful for demonstration purposes.
